## Flim

Flim is intended as a light-weight blogging application.  In a nutshell, it reads in articles from an `articles` directory that are in a `.flam` format.

It runs on Sinatra, and is currently targeted to work on DreamHost (which in theory should allow it to support any environment that can run on Rack).
